# automated_machinehealthchecks
A small python script that can check the health of a machine, including disk usage, cpu usage and network connectivity.

It's a small project that originated from Google IT automation with python professional certificate.
The aim of this project is to automate the task of checking machines' health status by utilising shutil and psutil modules of python libraries.
Moreover, a custom module namely "network" was scripted and used for the checking of network connectivity related matters.

The original version that intially uploaded is not an automated script. Users have to run the python script in CLI and read the error messages manually.
However, the code should be modified in the future to add some elements of automation into it and make it more fun!
